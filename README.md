# Kisan Mitr

Kisan Mitr was developed with a focus on delivering a streamlined, user-friendly interface tailored for farmers seeking accurate soil nutrient data. The app offers essential insights into Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) levels in soil, enabling data-driven crop management for improved yield and quality. It ensures easy access to information through an intuitive interface, minimizing the learning curve for users who may be less familiar with technology.
##Primary Functionalities:
- User Authentication: Farmers can quickly register and log in, with the app ensuring secure access to personalized data.
- Farmer Data Management: The app organizes user data efficiently, storing soil nutrient values for simple tracking and analysis over time.
- Soil Nutrient Testing: Through seamless USB connection to soil sensors, the app collects nutrient data with the Modbus RTU Protocol, directly capturing NPK values.
- Cost-Effective Testing Solution: Kisan Mitr bypasses the need for additional hardware such as Arduino by leveraging direct USB communication, reducing costs and setup complexity.
